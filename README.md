A [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) approximation of my custom responsive CSS demo (also viewable on [Glitch](https://brazen-aware-jade.glitch.me/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/partgnome/effective-train))

- Vanilla Javascript that handles toggling the collapsible navbar
- Custom stylesheet for the gradient used in the hero and changing the body background color
- Everything else is Bulma
